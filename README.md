# Lab 4 – Model Training + Versioning with GitHub Actions

This lab trains a RandomForest model on the Wine dataset.
On push to `main`, GitHub Actions:

✅ Installs dependencies  
✅ Trains the model automatically  
✅ Evaluates model performance  
✅ Saves timestamped model + metrics  
✅ Commits artifacts back to repo (versioning)

📂 Key folders:
- `src/` → model scripts
- `test/` → test files
- `.github/workflows` → CI automation
- `models/` → stored ML models (generated by CI)
- `metrics/` → performance logs (generated by CI)
